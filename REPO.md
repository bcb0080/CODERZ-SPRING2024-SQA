# 2
Created this repository and put the contents of MLForensics.zip into it

# 3
Created README.md and displayed our team members

# 4a
A pre-commit git hook was created that confirms any commit made to the repository. We were'nt sure how to confirm that the hook was working correctly, so we had to ask the professor and he told us to output it to a text file. Getting the ouput to a text file was a bit confusing at first, but we were able to modify the existing code.

# 4b
Fuzz methods were created to test the Average, Median, reportProp, and reportDensity methods in report.py and the reportProportion in frequency.py. The main focus was to test and catch invalid inputs into these methods.

# 4c
Lots of files from 

# 4d
Implemented continuous integration with codacy at codacy-analysis.yaml. The first couple of times it ran, it took a bit longer than we expected it to, but after a couple more tries, we were able to see that it ran successfully.
